                Hi!
                I'm Andres Arruti, a multidisciplinary Graphic Designer specialized in branding, packaging design and editorial design. At the end of 2021 I started my formation as a UX/UI Designer since it is what I want to dedicate myself to from now on.
                I was born on October 25, 1990 in Argentina and have been working in the field of graphic communication since 2010.
                During my last years at university and after obtaining my degree in Graphic and Advertising Design I have worked in a marketing agency as a Jr and Senior Graphic Designer, and I also work with my own freelance accounts.
                I was part of a small but hard working company dedicated to printing, and participated in design projects as a collaborator with colleagues from my dear Argentina.
                After that I moved to Italy and I get my italian citizenship, there I worked in a cosmetic lab and factory doing branding, packaging design and web pieces.
                Later I decided to change course a bit and I started studying UX/UI Design, I was working on some own and collaborative product design projects.

                I started working at Cosmomack as a graphic designer in the company's e-marketing team, creating posts for social media and other graphic pieces for the web, of the cosmetic lines that we commercialized.
                After a few months I started to design brand identities, inner packagings (containers) and outer packagings (boxes) for entire lines of own cosmetics (one of which is particularly large with 52 products) and for clients from different countries.
                I made boxes of different sizes and special characteristics, dealing directly with our suppliers.

                Within the company, in the printing and labeling area, the packaging is printed in silkscreen and pad printing. I was responsible for these processes with 2 people in my charge.

        <p>
            <h5>
                I led a team of 4 graphic designers deciding the creative ways for advertising graphic pieces, becoming responsable of the final artworks (flat graphics, motion graphics and videos). I worked in a few campaigns doing the scheduling in advertising media, along with other managers.
                Weekly we worked on the design of an 8-pages product catalog, published digitally and printed in 600,000 weekly copies, different advertising pieces, radio and television spots for our main client: www.almacor.com.ar, a national chain of supermarkets with more than 70 locations.
                I worked in the design and assembly of marketing-stands and exhibitors for national and international brands, also worked in the design and production of graphic pieces for set up supermarkets and commercial premises.

                I worked in teams of 2 or 3 designers making graphic pieces including entire brands, web posts, packagings and advertising catalogs, among others, and prepare the final deigns for printing because the most of these pieces were printed in offset.
                Also I did Illustrations for audiovisual pieces.
